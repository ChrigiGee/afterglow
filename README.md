# Don't use this branch!

This branch is under heavy development. The builds should be mostly working, but there is no point in using an unstable branch. Except if you want to, of course.

## Documentation

There is a full documentation available here: [docs.afterglowplayer.com](http://docs.afterglowplayer.com).

## Build status

Green is good (means: all unit tests are passing). Red is bad (means: think before you use it). Gray is nothing (means: test are running right now, come back in a second).

The build status isn't reliable yet, as there is a major refactoring going on.
